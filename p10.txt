Password Encryption and Cracking with CrypTool and Cain and Abel  
1.Password Encryption and Decryption:  
• Use CrypTool to encrypt passwords using the RC4 algorithm.  
• Decrypt the encrypted passwords and verify the original values.  
2. Password Cracking and Wireless Network Password Decoding:  
• Use Cain and Abel to perform a dictionary attack on Windows account passwords.  
• Decode wireless network passwords using Cain and Abel's capabilities.  
1. crypTool  
Step 1: Open crypTool on your computer.  
Step 2: Deleted all the text by default and type the text you want to encrypt 
Step3: Click on the “Encrypt/ Decrypt” tab and select “Symmetric(modern)” option and in that 
option click on “RC4” and click “encrypt”.  
Encrypt/Decrypt > Symmetric(modern) > RC4 > Encrypt  
Step 4: You will see the encrypted text . Now Again click on Encrypt/Decrypt option and follow 
the below sequence of options to select.  
Encrypt/Decrypt > Symmetric(modern) > RC4 > Decrypt 
Step 5: You will see the original plaintext.

• Linux Network Analysis and ARP Poisoning  
1. Linux Network Analysis:  
a. Execute the ifconfig command to retrieve network interface information.  
b. Use the ping command to test network connectivity and analyze the output 
c. Analyze the netstat command output to view active network connections.  
d. Perform a traceroute to trace the route packets take to reach a target host. 
2. ARP Poisoning:  
a. Use ARP poisoning techniques to redirect network traffic on a Windows system.  
i. Use arp-a command on linux as well as windows to chack available connections with MAC 
addresses.  
ii. Now open Ettercap on kali linux and startsniffing for available hosts. 
iii. Now set the targets which is windows machine.  
iv. Now select Man-in-the-Middle attack (MITM) and select ARP Poisoning 
v. Select “Sniffremote connections.” 
vi. Now open the wireshark app in linux to trace ARP Poisoning packets. 
vii. The linux wireshark trace the packets sent by the windows for more details see below picture.  
b. Analyze the effects of ARP poisoning on network communication and security. 
i. The MAC address of sender gets change due to ARP Poisoning  
ii. The changes I OPCODE  
Note: Normally the {OPCODE: request (1)} but after poisoning the its {OPCODE: request (2)} as 
linux sent unwanted response that windows never asked for.

Port Scanning with Nmap 
A. Use NMap to perform an ACK scan to determine if a port is filtered, unfiltered, or open.  
NOTE: Install Nmap for windows and install it. After that open cmd and type “nmap” to check 
if it is installed properly. Now type the below commands.  
1. ACK -sA (TCP ACK scan)  
It never determines open (or even open|filtered) ports. It is used to map out firewall rulesets, 
determining whether they are stateful or not and which ports are filtered.  
Command: nmap -sA -T4 www.google.com 
B. Perform SYN, FIN, NULL, and XMAS scans to identify open ports and their characteristics.  
1. SYN (Stealth) Scan (-sS)  
SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reason. It can be performed quickly, 
scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by intrusive firewalls.  
Command: nmap -p22,113,139 www.google.com  
2. FIN Scan (-sF)  
Sets just the TCP FIN bit.     Command: nmap -sF -T4 www.google.com 
3. NULL Scan (-sN) 
Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)  
Command: nmap –sN –p 22 scanme.nmap.org  
4. XMAS Scan (-sX) Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree. 
Command: nmap -sX -T4 www.google.com 


Practical 5 
Network Traffic Capture and DoS Attack with Wireshark and Nemesy  
A. Network Traffic Capture:  
Use Wireshark to capture network traffic on a specific network interface.  
Analyze the captured packets to extract relevant information and identify potential security 
issues.  
Open Wireshark software and select interface. 
Open any http website and add display filter as http. 
Right click on packet >> POST method >> Follow >> TCP stream  
Search for ‘credentials’ in the dialog box. 
B. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:  
Use Nemesy to launch a DoS attack against a target system or network.  
Observe the impact of the attack on the target's availability and performance.  
• Open Nemesy software and enter target IP, number of packets , size of packet, delay 
between packets.  
(r – random packet size)  
• Also, you can use the hping3 tool which is available in kali Linux for DoS attack.  -S : SYN flag  --flood : sent packets as fast as possible. Don't show replies.  -V : verbose mode  -p : destination port (default 0)
