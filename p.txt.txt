p1 .  Aim: Document Indexing and Retrieval
      ●	Implement an inverted index construction algorithm.
      ●	Build a simple document retrieval system using the constructed index.

P2 . Aim: Retrieval Models
    ●	Implement the Boolean retrieval model and process queries.
    ●	Implement the vector space model with TF-IDF weighting and cosine similarity

P3 . Aim: Spelling Correction in IR Systems
    ●	Develop a spelling correction module using edit distance algorithms.
    ●	Integrate the spelling correction module into an information retrieval system.

P4 .  Evaluation Metrics for IR Systems
      A)	Calculate precision, recall, and F-measure for a given set of retrieval results.
        B)	Use an evaluation toolkit to measure average precision and other evaluation metrics

P5 .  Aim: Text Categorization
        A)	Implement a text classification algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines).
      B)	Train the classifier on a labelled dataset and evaluate its performance.

p6  Aim: Clustering for Information Retrieval
    Implement a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means or hierarchical clustering).
    Apply the clustering algorithm to a set of documents and evaluate the clustering results.

p7. Aim: Web Crawling and Indexing
    A)	Develop a web crawler to fetch and index web pages.
    B)	Handle challenges such as robots.txt, dynamic content, and crawling delays.

p8.  Link Analysis and PageRank
